Risk attitude is formally modeled as the shape of a decision maker’s utility profile (see Weber, Blais, & Betz (2002) for an overview of different risk frameworks). Measures of risk attitude assess decision makers’ perceptions of risk and/or their preferred levels of risk. We distinguish between three separate approaches to measurement of risk attitude:	

1. [Behavioral measures of risk](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Risk%20Attitude.html#Behavioral): determine individuals' risk preferences from actual choices made in games or scenarios, both real and hypothetical		
2. [Measures of risk attitude](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Risk%20Attitude.html#Attitude): use self-report questionnaires that directly query individuals about risky situations	
3. [Measures of personality traits related to risk](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Risk%20Attitude.html#Personality): assess risk attitude through individuals’ self-reports of personality traits related to risk-taking and aversion.		
Closely related to risk attitude is ambiguity attitude. Ambiguity is defined as "uncertainty about uncertainty" (see Lauriola, Levin, and Hart, 2007). An alternate and broader definition of ambiguity is insufficient information. Measures of ambiguity (in)tolerance are closely related to epistemic motivation measures, such as Need for (Cognitive) Closure.


## Behavioral Measures of Risk 行为任务测量风险

* Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) 模拟气球风险任务

	Purpose：The BART was designed to assess risk preferences through choices made in a scenario.		
	Questions：Participants inflate a computerized balloon. The goal is to inflate the balloon to its maximum inflation, but not more. Each "successful" pump is worth 5 cents. If the balloon is inflated past its individual explosion point, it pops and Ps lose all money earned on that balloon.   	
	There are 90 trials with three different color balloons. Each color (unbeknownst to Ps) represents a different probability of popping.
