### Correlation and Standardized Regression



In this chapter, you will learn about correlation and its role in regression. To do so, we will use the [keith-gpa.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/modeling/master/data/keith-gpa.csv) data to examine whether time spent on homework is related to GPA. The data contain three attributes collected from a random sample of n=100n=100 8th-grade students (see the [data codebook](http://zief0002.github.io/epsy-8251/codebooks/keith-gpa.html)). To begin, we will load several libraries and import the data into an object called `keith`.

We collected correlation coeﬃcients as well as regression coeﬃcients; when only the latter were available we transformed these into correlation coeﬃcients (see for calculation details: Peterson and Brown, 2005).
